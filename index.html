  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- Write your intro here -->
    I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in  Decisions and Information Sciences at C. T. Bauer College of Business, University of Houston. 
    My research interests fall in behavioral operations and human-AI interaction. Specifically, I study how algorithm design influences human decision-making. 
    I use methods including lab experiments, field experiments, analytical modeling, and reinforcement learning.
